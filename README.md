Presentation: 
For our group final Project for the 2021-2022 Columbia Boot we selected the topic of Fair Trade. Specially around conditions of farmers. The database we used was from surveys done by migrant farmers in California. There were 2 surveys done a year apart. There were over 30 questions on the survey. The data was then complied into the Excel file we are using. We hope to determine the best conditions to determine the optimum job satisfaction. It might be a certain Farm or a certain job, but we hope to find out.

GitHub: 
The team worked together on GitHub, slack, and during class time in our breakout rooms. We were even able to get a second breakout room. One room was involved in cleaning the data. The other room was where the README.md file was worked on. 

Machine Learning Model: 
We had a few people make preliminary Machine Learning Models. The first one picked certain columns to look at, then dropped all the NAs which dropped about 30 entries of data. Looking at the x describe and y describe was what promoted the use of dropnas command. The code also used a dictionary for the number values which attached ratings for each number. This code ended in a 11 by 11 matrix with a 15% accuracy.

Databased: 
When we first got the database, we looked through the excel file and did a preliminary clean up by deleting columns we didnâ€™t need. We started out with <enter original number of columns> and ended up with <enter clean data number of columns>. We then coded in Python and read the file into the code. The cleaned file then went through additional cleaning before we put it through our Machine Learning Model.
